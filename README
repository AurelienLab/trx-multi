trx is a simple toolset for broadcasting live audio. It is based on
the Opus codec <http://www.opus-codec.org/> and sends and receives
encoded audio over IP networks.

It can be used for point-to-point audio links or multicast,
eg. private transmitter links or audio distribution. In contrast to
traditional streaming, high quality wideband audio (such as music) can
be sent with low-latency and fast recovery from dropouts.

With quality audio hardware and wired ethernet, a total latency of no
more than a few milliseconds is possible.

I've upgrade the original program to create an auto managed aoIP
Client / Server system.
You can launch rx with option -i N to open N ortp sessions on N
consecutives ports. You can define the first port with -p option.
It creates slots. If an other client wants to connect, it has
to wait in waiting list (FIFO) until a slot is free.

You can launch tx with option -w. If the option is set and no slots
are free on the server, the client will wait for a free slot, else
it will just stop.

Actually, there are few debug messages remaining. I'll clean them
very soon.
